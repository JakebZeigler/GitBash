"HOW TO GENERATE AN SSH KEY FOR GIT!"
_______________________________________
1) "Open Git Bash and enter the following command, replacing your_email@example.com with your email:"
Bash Code:
$- ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
"When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default file location."

2) "Add Your SSH Key to the ssh-agent:"
Bash Code:
$- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

3) "Then, add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:"
Bash Code:
$- ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

4) "Add Your SSH Public Key to Your GitHub Account:"
Bash Code:
$- Run cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
"To display your SSH public key. Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard."

5) "On GitHub, go to "Settings" > "SSH and GPG keys.""
Click on "New SSH key," paste your SSH key, and save it.

6) "Change the remote URL of your repository from HTTPS to SSH."
"Replace your-repository-url with your actual repository SSH:"
Bash Code:
$- git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repositorySSHTok.git

7) "Now, you can push changes using SSH without being prompted to log in via a browser:"
Bash Code:
$- git add .
git commit -m "Update"
git push origin master
